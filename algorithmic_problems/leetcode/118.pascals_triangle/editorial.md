# [118. Pascal’s Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/)

**Problem.**\
In Pascal’s Triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above
it.

**Example:**

Input: numRows = 5\
Output:

- [1]
- [1, 1]
- [1, 2, 1]
- [1, 3, 3, 1]
- [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]

### Building up to the solution

**Things to take into account...**

- The top-most row consists on a single number `1`.
- Each row begins and ends with `1`.
- The inner elements of a row are the sum of the two numbers directly above it
  from the previous row.
- A row's values are only dependant on the values that are directly above it.

If you visualize the triangle:

1

1 1

1 2 1

1 3 3 1

1 4 6 4 1

you can see that every non-edge number has two parents above it: one to the left
and one to the right.

Let's remember that, in order to construct the `i`-th row, we only need the
`(i-1)`-th row.

So, accessing the desired row in any given iteration where $i > 0$, can be done
by:

desiredRow = triangle[i - 1]

Given that `desiredRow` is just a list, we can access its elements by doing the
following:

desired_element_from_row = desiredRow[j]

$0 \le j < \text{len(desiredRow)}$

Hence:

desired_element_from_row = triangle[i - 1][j]

### Approach

For every row `i`:

1. Initialize a list of size `i + 1` filled with `1`s.
2. For every inner index `j` in that row, compute\
   `row[j] = triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j]`.
3. Append the constructed row to `triangle`.

# Complexity

- Time complexity: $O(n^2)$

  The total number of elements in the triangle is
  $1 + 2 + 3 + … + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = O(n^2)$.

- Space complexity: $O(n^2)$

  We do need to store all rows of the triangle.
